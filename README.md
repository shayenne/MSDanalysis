# MSDanalysis

You need to do some steps before run the code:

  1. Follow the steps described in https://github.com/eltonlaw/msdvis until 'python -m run.py' (it will not work)
  1. Get the files from this repository and replace them on msdvis directory
  1. Install [Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html) library
  1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the required dependencies
  1. Run: 'python -m run' and verify all necessary libraries
  1. Install all libraries, if you do not have (numpy, scikit, tables, etc...) 
  1. Run the Jupyter Notebook (and wait...)
